One of significant techniques for digital museum is to provide an authoring environment where users can create and maintain digital museums by themselves.
For it's goal, we have been developing a digital museum system D-Cubis.
Using a Web browser, 
users can freely walk through digital museums created by D-Cubis.
A digital museum of D-Cubis consists of 3D space information, multimedia content information and their layout information, all of which can be easily written by users.


However, it is difficult for visitors to know which contents are newly introduced, and which contents they have not seen.
Moreover, they do not know which contents are more popular.
To solve the above problems, this paper proposes a system which records and analyzes visitors behavior.
