It is important by the learning of the C Language to repeat a process programing.
Teachers make the learner repeatedly answer the exercise, and are aiming at established of knowledge in the class. 
However, it takes trouble for a teacher to make a lot of exercises.

In this paper, we propose the learning system that uses Fill-in-the-Blank question for C language.
It has a function to generate a Fill-in-the-Blank question for C language automatically. 
And this system enables study that uses a Fill-in-the-Bland question. 
It proposes the method of setting questions that switches the problem of setting questions
 by using a relation and various evaluation approaches of the problem.
Furthermore, The system perform the marking that considered the difference of how to write program every learner with a syntax tree.
